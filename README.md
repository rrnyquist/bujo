# BuJo: A small Bullet Journal addon for Obsidian
I recently came across the [Bullet Journal Method](https://bulletjournal.com/). Something that impressed me about this method was how simple the basic tenets of the "rapid logging" system were: just a few types of bullets, each one quick to handwrite and easy to read. All the non-actionable bullet items take up the space of a block letter, while the actionable ones (the bullets) are pretty easy to pick out. Instantly, I wanted to implement the format into my favorite note-taking app, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Although there already exists a wonderful Obsidian theme called [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/home/) (I highly recommend you go check it out), I decided the formatting syntax needed to be *just so* and so I decided to [make something from scratch](https://x.com/vincentdnl/status/1268573228626333703). 

So, if you like the bullet journal method, you are now able to get the "bullet journal" look with just the few lines of additional CSS. It has been tested on both the default and Minimal themes. 

Enjoy!
